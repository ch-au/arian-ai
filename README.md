# ARIAN - AI Negotiation Platform

An advanced AI-powered negotiation simulation platform that enables automated negotiations between AI agents with configurable personalities, tactics, and ZOPA (Zone of Possible Agreement) boundaries.

## üöÄ Features

- **AI-to-AI Negotiations**: Automated negotiations using OpenAI GPT-4o models
- **Configurable AI Personalities**: Big Five personality traits configuration for realistic agent behavior
- **Influencing Techniques & Tactics**: Database-driven technique and tactic selection for negotiations
- **Real-time Monitoring**: WebSocket-based live negotiation updates
- **Combinatorial Testing**: Test multiple technique-tactic combinations automatically
- **ZOPA Analysis**: Zone of Possible Agreement boundary validation and overlap analysis
- **Performance Analytics**: Comprehensive metrics tracking and reporting
- **Multi-round Negotiations**: Support for extended negotiation sessions

## üõ† Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for build tooling
- **Wouter** for routing
- **TanStack Query** for state management
- **Shadcn/ui** with Radix UI components
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **WebSocket** for real-time updates

### Backend
- **Express.js** with TypeScript
- **PostgreSQL** with Drizzle ORM
- **Neon** serverless PostgreSQL
- **OpenAI API** for AI agent intelligence
- **Langfuse** for AI observability and tracing
- **WebSocket** server for real-time communication

## üìä System Architecture

The platform follows a modern full-stack architecture with separated concerns:

1. **Agent Configuration**: Configure AI personalities, tactics, and boundaries
2. **Negotiation Setup**: Define contexts, products, and market conditions
3. **Negotiation Engine**: Process negotiations with OpenAI integration
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket-based live monitoring
5. **Analytics**: Performance tracking and reporting

## üîß Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- PostgreSQL database
- OpenAI API key

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file with:
```env
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_langfuse_public_key (optional)
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=your_langfuse_secret_key (optional)
```

### Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Push database schema
npm run db:push

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`
