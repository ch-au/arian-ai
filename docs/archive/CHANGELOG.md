- Interfaces for components and utilities
- **Types:** 15+ comprehensive interfaces

#### Tests (Following FIRST Principles)

**Analytics Utils Test Suite** (`tests/analytics-utils.test.ts`)
- **Test Count:** 50+ comprehensive test cases
- **Coverage Areas:**
  - Success rate calculations (5 tests)
  - Average rounds calculations (4 tests)
  - Cost calculations (5 tests)
  - Deal value scoring (5 tests)
  - Grouping and matrix building (6 tests)
  - Heatmap color generation (4 tests)
  - Histogram binning (4 tests)
  - Moving averages (3 tests)
  - Formatting functions (9 tests)
- **Principles:**
  - Fast - Pure functions, no I/O
  - Independent - No test dependencies
  - Repeatable - Deterministic results
  - Self-validating - Clear pass/fail
  - Timely - Written with code

### 🧹 Cleaned Up

1. **Removed Duplicate Files**
   - ❌ Deleted `client/src/pages/simulation-monitor-improved.tsx` (809 lines)
   - ❌ Deleted `scripts/run_production_negotiation 2.py` (duplicate script)
   - ❌ Removed Python cache files from git tracking

2. **Updated .gitignore**
   - Added comprehensive Python ignore patterns
   - Added `.venv/` and virtual environment folders
   - Cleaned up tracked cache files

3. **Updated Routing**
   - Changed `/analysis` → `/analysis/:negotiationId` for direct access
   - Integrated new AnalysisDashboard component
   - Removed placeholder Analysis component dependency

### 📐 Architecture Improvements

#### Clean Code Principles Applied

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - Each component has one clear purpose
   - Utilities are pure functions with single jobs
   - Separation of smart (container) and dumb (presentational) components

2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
   - Shared utilities in `analytics-utils.ts`
   - Reusable components (MetricCard, HeatmapCell, etc.)
   - Common type definitions

3. **Testability**
   - Pure functions for all business logic
   - Memoized calculations for performance
   - No direct DOM manipulation
   - Props-based component composition

4. **Readability**
   - Clear, descriptive function names
   - Comprehensive JSDoc comments
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - Consistent code formatting

5. **Performance**
   - Memoized expensive calculations
   - Loading skeletons instead of spinners
   - Efficient React rendering patterns
   - Lazy calculation of analytics
