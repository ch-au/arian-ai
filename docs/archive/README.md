Historical documents and experiments live here. They are kept for reference but are not part of the active documentation set.

Contents include:
- `ROADMAP.md` – Legacy product roadmap.
- `TECHNICAL_IMPROVEMENTS.md` – Original backlog of technical cleanup tasks.
- `SIMULATION_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` – Early UI mock and crash-recovery notes.
- `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` – Preliminary design system draft.
- `OPENAI_AGENTS_INTEGRATION.md` – Detailed integration write-up superseded by `docs/AGENTS.md`.
- `negotiation-engine-production.ts` – Reference implementation for the Python/TypeScript bridge.

Move additional legacy docs here instead of keeping them alongside the active guides.
