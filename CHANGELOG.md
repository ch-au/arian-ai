- **Coverage Areas:**
  - Success rate calculations (5 tests)

  - Self-validating - Clear pass/fail
  - Timely - Written with code

### üßπ Cleaned Up

1. **Removed Duplicate Files**
   - ‚ùå Deleted `client/src/pages/simulation-monitor-improved.tsx` (809 lines)
   - ‚ùå Deleted `scripts/run_production_negotiation 2.py` (duplicate script)
   - ‚ùå Removed Python cache files from git tracking

2. **Updated .gitignore**
   - Added comprehensive Python ignore patterns
   - Added `.venv/` and virtual environment folders
   - Cleaned up tracked cache files

3. **Updated Routing**
   - Changed `/analysis` ‚Üí `/analysis/:negotiationId` for direct access
   - Integrated new AnalysisDashboard component
   - Removed placeholder Analysis component dependency

### üìê Architecture Improvements

#### Clean Code Principles Applied

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - Each component has one clear purpose
   - Utilities are pure functions with single jobs
   - Separation of smart (container) and dumb (presentational) components

2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
   - Shared utilities in `analytics-utils.ts`
   - Reusable components (MetricCard, HeatmapCell, etc.)
   - Common type definitions

3. **Testability**
   - Pure functions for all business logic
   - Memoized calculations for performance
   - No direct DOM manipulation
   - Props-based component composition

4. **Readability**
   - Clear, descriptive function names
   - Comprehensive JSDoc comments
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - Consistent code formatting

5. **Performance**
   - Memoized expensive calculations
   - Loading skeletons instead of spinners
   - Efficient React rendering patterns
   - Lazy calculation of analytics

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Duplicate Files | 2 | 0 | ‚úÖ -100% |
| Analysis Page LOC | 19 | 280 | üìà +1374% |
